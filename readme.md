Given a movie file, still images picked at random times are created.

From these images, two are shown to the player. The images must be sorted in chronological order. Success will give the player points, increase the challenge by adding new images to sort and reveal the timestamp of sorted images. Failure removes points. A best score is kept in a cookie file.

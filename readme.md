Given a movie file, still images picked at random times are created.

From these images, two are shown to the player. The images must be sorted in chronological order. Success will:<br>
.Give the player points<br>
.Reveal the timestamp of sorted images.<br>
.Increase the challenge by adding new images to sort<br>
Failure removes points. A best score is kept in a cookie file.<br>
